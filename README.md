# Time_series_R_work
####This file includes Non-stationary time series models, stationary time series models, Differencing and other models.

1. Time_series Ass1 - Time series intro [a link](https://github.com/CameronTodd1123/Time_series_R_work/blob/master/assignment/assignment1/Assignment_1_stats326__5611230_.docx) basic plotting of time series data 

2. Time_series Ass2 - Non-stationary time series [a link](https://github.com/CameronTodd1123/Time_series_R_work/blob/master/assignment/assignment2/Assignment2_stats326__5611230_finalcopy.docx) Use of stl plots (to split seasonal, trend and random components), plotting de-seasonalised data, fitted seasonally adjusted moving averages model with predictions and prediction intervals, Fitted Holt winters model. Also fitted many other time series models here [a link](https://github.com/CameronTodd1123/Time_series_R_work/blob/master/assignment/daft%20all%20models%20practice/STATS%20326_A2_5611230%20full%20models.Rmd) to discover which model was best before fitting moving averages and Holt winters. In this file I fitted seasonal factor model, Cosine harmonic model, Full harmonic model, seasonally adjusted moving averages, seasonally adjusted STL model and Holt Winters model. I compared all these models by calculating the RMSEP.

3. Time_series Ass3 - Stationary time series [a link](https://github.com/CameronTodd1123/Time_series_R_work/blob/master/assignment/assingment3/Assignment3_stats326%205611230.pdf) Use of acf plots, pacf plots, residual plots and ARIMA model and equations.

4. Time_series Ass4 - SARIMA models and predictions [a link](https://github.com/CameronTodd1123/Time_series_R_work/blob/master/assignment/assignment4/Assignment4_stats326__5611230_final.docx) Use of acf plots, pacf plots, residual plots, ARIMA and SARIMA models and predictions, calculations of RMSEP
